1) Login Page: 
	a)Input Fields:
		Username:
				1) Accepts only Letters, digits and @ . + - _ (Django defaults). In login page it wont show error dynamically and diasble submit button because that will make bruteforce attack easy on the site.

				--> After Login is clicked A error message displays showing invalid credentials.

	b)The navigation bar login option to help user login from any page he is in of the website.		

2) Branch Change form Page:

	--> Every errors are displayed dynamically as u type in and submit button is disabled.

	a)Input Fields:
		Roll No:
			1)Only Rollnos Starting with 15 and third digit may be D or 0-9 and after that digits only(Used Regular expression of javascript)
				-> Errors are displayed dynamically just below the field with a cross mark in the field
				-> Submit button disabled until corrected.
			2)Input length rerstricted to 9 , that one cant tyoe more than 9 digits. This means after 9th digit even user types a number that wont

		Preferences:
			1) In this option all branches are vailable except the presnet branch. Whatever branch one select in present branch, That option 
			becomes unavialble in preferneces lists.

			2)Prefernces list appears dynamically.

			3)If someone tries to enter the same branch in two fields, a warninig popups and the values of the two fields get swapped
			automatically.
				This was done to ease user to make drastic changes in his prefernces a little easy.
			4)If someone enters none in between the preferences list all fields below that will be removed.
